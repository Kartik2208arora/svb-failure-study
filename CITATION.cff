    abstract: "This research paper examines the factors that contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, a commercial bank that primarily served the innovation sector, including technology, life sciences, healthcare, private equity, and venture capital industries. The paper first provides an overview of the banking industry and how it operates, including the regulatory environment for banks in the United States. The paper then describes Silicon Valley Bank's business model and the types of clients it served, which ranged from early-stage start-ups to established companies in the technology and life sciences industries. The paper analyzes three main factors that contributed to the bank's failure: the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates, cash sickness among some of the bank's customers, and the bank's sale of a debt portfolio at a loss. The research paper concludes by highlighting the importance of effective risk management in the banking industry and the need for banks to be prepared for unexpected events that could impact their operations. Overall, this paper provides valuable insights into the factors that contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and offers important lessons for other banks operating in the innovation economy."
